OOP program that works with the requests module to make API requests. than I utilizes the html library to clean the HTML elements from the text data obtained through the API request. The tkinter library is employed to build the graphical user interface.

This is an upgraded version of a previous project that I completed months ago. The original project involved creating a quiz game using a static file containing a dictionary of questions and answers. The process includes selecting a question, displaying it to the user, receiving the user's answer, checking if it is correct or not, incrementing the user's score, and loading the next question. The interaction is through the terminal.

In this second version, I added a graphical user interface that displays the question to the user along with their score. The interface includes two buttons for acquiring the user's response. Unlike the previous version where the user had to input 'true' or 'false,' this version provides buttons for a more user-friendly experience.

Another enhancement is the use of the Trivia Database API instead of a static file for obtaining questions. This allows for a dynamic selection of the type of questions to present

Implement the possibility for the user to choose the type of question they want, the quantity, and difficulty.
